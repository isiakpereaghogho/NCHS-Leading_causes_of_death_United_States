# NCHS-Leading_causes_of_death_United_States
This project presents the age-adjusted death rates for the 10 leading causes of death in the United States beginning in 1999

 1. Define the Goal (Introduction)
State the problem/question: What are you trying to discover or analyze?

Context: Brief background of the topic/dataset.

Objectives: Clear and concise explanation of what your analysis aims to achieve.

Example: “This report analyzes customer churn data to identify the key drivers of customer attrition in Q1 2025.”

2. Describe the Dataset (Data Description)
Source: Where the data came from.

Structure: Number of rows, columns, types of variables (categorical, numerical, etc.).

Key Variables: Highlight the most relevant features.

Limitations: Any known issues like missing data, biases, or anomalies.

Example: “The dataset consists of 10,000 customer records, including demographic data, usage patterns, and subscription status.”

3. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Explain how you handled:

Missing values

Outliers

Data type conversions

Feature engineering or encoding

Include relevant code snippets or visuals (if needed).

Example: “Null values in ‘age’ were imputed using the median. One-hot encoding was applied to the ‘region’ column.”

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Use visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps).

Highlight patterns, trends, or correlations.

Address questions like:

What are the distributions?

Are there clusters or anomalies?

Which features are related?

“Churn rate is significantly higher among users with monthly contracts compared to annual contracts.”

 5. Statistical Analysis or Modeling
If applicable, explain:

Hypothesis testing

Regression analysis

Classification models

Clustering, etc.

Include model performance metrics: accuracy, R², confusion matrix, AUC, etc.

“A logistic regression model was trained to predict churn, achieving an accuracy of 85% on the test set.”

 6. Key Findings / Insights
Summarize the most important insights from your analysis.

Use bullet points or tables for clarity.

Clearly link back to your original objectives.

“Customers with tenure < 6 months are 3x more likely to churn.”

 7. Recommendations
Actionable suggestions based on findings.

What should stakeholders do with this information?
